# Contributing to CreacionesBaby

First off, thank you for considering contributing to CreacionesBaby. It's people like you that make the open-source community such a great place to learn, inspire, and create.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, please [open an issue](https://github.com/GrullonDev/creacionesbaby/issues) first to discuss it before opening a Pull Request.

## Branching Strategy

- `main` is our production branch. It should always be stable and deployable.
- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix: `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/your-fix-name`.

## Commit Messages

We try to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:
- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Ensure you have run `flutter format .` and `flutter analyze`.
3. Make sure your code passes the existing tests (`flutter test`).
4. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

See the [README.md](README.md) for instructions on how to set up the project locally.
